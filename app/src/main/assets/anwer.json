        "question":"\nWith so much focus on children's use of screens, it's easy for parents to forget about their own screen use. \"Tech is designed to really suck on you in,\" says Jenny Radesky in her study of digital play, \"and digital products are there to promote maximal engagement. It makes it hard to disengage,andleadstoalotofbleed-overintothefamilyroutine.\" Radesky has studied the use of mobile phones and tablets at mealtimes by giving mother-child pairs a food-testing exercise. She found that mothers who sued devices during the exercise started 20 percent fewer verbal and 39 percent fewer nonverbal interactions with their children. During a separate observation, she saw that phones became a source of tension in the family. Parents would be looking at their emails while the children would be making excited bids fortheirattention. Infants are wired to look at parents' faces to try to understand their world, and if those faces are blank and unresponsive—as they often are when absorbed in a device—it can be extremely disconcerting foe the children. Radesky cites the \"still face experiment\" devised by developmental psychologist EdTronickin the 1970s. In it, a mother is asked to interact with her child in a normal way before putting on a blank expression and not giving them any visual social feedback; The child becomes increasingly distressed as she tries to capture her mother's attention. \"Parents don't have to be exquisitely parents at all times, but there needs to be a balance and parents need to be responsive and sensitive to a child's verbal or nonverbal expressions of an emotional need,\" says Radesky. On the other hand, Tronick himself is concerned that the worries about kids' use of screens are born out of an \"oppressive ideology that demands that parents should always be interacting\" with their children: \"It's based on a somewhat fantasized, very white, very upper-middle-class ideology that says if you're failing to expose your child to 30,000 words you are neglecting them.\" Tronick believes that just because a child isn't learning from the screen doesn't mean there's no value to it—particularly if it gives parents time to have a shower, do housework or simply have a break from their child. Parents, he says, can get a lot out of using their devices to speak to a friend or get some work out of the way. This can make them feel happier, which lets then be more availabletotheir childtherestofthetime. \n\n26.AccordingtoJennyRadesky,digitalproductsaredesignedto______. \n[A]simplify routinematters \n[B]absorbuserattention \n[C]betterinterpersonalrelations \n[D]increaseworkefficiency\n\n27.Radesky's food-testingexerciseshowsthatmothers'useofdevices______. \n[A]takes awaybabies'appetite \n[B]distracts children'sattention \n[C]slows downbabies'verbaldevelopment \n[D]reducesmother-childcommunication\n\n28.Radesky's citesthe\"still faceexperiment\"toshowthat_______. \n[A]it iseasyforchildrentogetusedtoblankexpressions \n[B]verbal expressionsareunnecessaryforemotionalexchange \n[C]childrenareinsensitive tochangesintheirparents'mood \n[D]parentsneedtorespondtochildren's emotionalneeds \n29.Theoppressiveideology mentionedbyTronickrequiresparentsto_______. \n[A]protectkids fromexposuretowild fantasies \n[B]teachtheirkidsatleast30,000wordsayear \n[C]ensureconstantinteractionwiththeirchildren \n[D]remainconcernedaboutkid's useofscreens\n\n30.AccordingtoTronick,kid's useofscreensmay_______. \n[A]give theirparentssome freetime \n[B]make theirparentsmorecreative \n[C]helpthemwith theirhomework \n[D]helpthembecomemoreattentive ",

        "question":"\nToday, widespread social pressure to immediately go to college in conjunction with increasingly high expectations in a fast-moving world often causes students to completely overlook the possibility of taking a gap year.After all, if everyone you know is going to college in the fall, it seems silly to stay back a year, doesn't it? And after going to school for 12 years, it doesn't feelnaturaltospendayear doingsomethingthatisn't academic. \nBut while this may be true, it's not a good enough reason to condemn gap years. There's always a constant fear of falling behind everyone else on the socially perpetuated \"race to the finish line,\" whether that be toward graduate school, medical school or lucrative career. But despite common misconceptions, a gap year does not hinder the success of academic pursuits—in fact,itprobablyenhancesit.\n Studies from the United States and Australia show that students who take a gap year are generally better prepared for and perform better in college than those who do not. Rather than pulling students back, a gap year pushes them ahead by preparing them for independence, new responsibilities and environmental changes—all things that first-year students often struggle with the most. Gap year experiences can lessen the blow when it comes to adjusting to college and being thrown into a brand new environment, making it easier to focus on academics and activities ratherthanacclimationblunders. If you're not convinced of the inherent value in taking a year off to explore interests, then consider its financial impact on future academic choices. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, nearly 80 percent of college students end up changing their majors at least once.This isn't surprising, consideringthe basic mandatory high school curriculum leaves students with a poor understanding of themselves listing one major on their college applications, but switching to another after taking college classes. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but depending on the school, it can be costly to make up credits after switching too late in the game. At Boston College, for example, you would have to complete an extra year were you to switch to the nursing school from another department. Taking a gap year to figure things out initially can help prevent stressandsave moneylateron. 31.Oneofthereasonsforhigh-schoolgraduatesnottakingagap yearisthat .
